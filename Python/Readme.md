# 100 Days of Code (Python) - Udemy

ðŸ’¡ Dr. Angela Yu's course, [_100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp_](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/), aims to create fluent and well-rounded Python developers by exposing them to a wide array of Python programming concepts and techniques for 100 days straight. After completing the course, although I didn't complete it within the 100 days, I can confidently say that this was undoubtedly the best online course I've ever taken. Not only did I learn Python from zero-to-hero, but I was also taught things that most other courses skip over such as, but not limited to:
* The importance of understanding the underlying theory behind the code we write
* How to learn effectively and efficiently, and continue to grow your skills
* How to comply with industry best practices and standards as related to Python development
